" Vim has a gf command (and related, <C-W><C-F> to open in new tab) which open file whose name is under or after the cursor. This feature is extremely useful for browsing header files.By default, Vim searches file in working directory. However, most projects have separated directory for include files. Thus, you should set Vimâ€™s path option to contain a comma-separated list of directories to look for the file.
